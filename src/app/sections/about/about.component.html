      When word spread that a farmer's market was starting in town, this hobby
      baker knew it was time to open a small business. We are a home bakery,
      officially referred to in legal parlance as a Cottage Food Operator; our
      home is little and red. And so, we became Red Cottage Bakery!

      We favor classic desserts and familiar flavors. Our menu is a blend of
      heritage recipes passed down through generations, re-creations of
      nostalgia desserts and enduring favorites from well-worn books. We bake
      with the seasons, using premium and local ingredients at every
      opportunity.

    <p>Baking brings joy. Thank you for sharing in our fun.</p>
